# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Code Review Bot is a production-ready automated system that analyzes backend API code for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and best practices violations. The system integrates with GitHub webhooks to provide intelligent feedback using LLMs with cost tracking, automatically generates fix PRs with CI validation, supports custom rules via plugins, and notifies teams via Slack/Discord with gamified metrics. The bot aims to reduce manual code review time by 90% while maintaining high code quality standards and providing transparent cost tracking.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: GitHub Integration and Webhook Processing

**User Story:** As a development team, I want the bot to automatically analyze pull requests when they are created or updated, so that code quality issues are caught early in the development process.

2. WHEN a fix PR is created THEN the system SHALL run CI tests on the fix branch before marking as ready
3. WHEN CI validation completes THEN the system SHALL update GitHub check status with results
4. WHEN merge conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and notify the developer
5. IF CI tests fail THEN the system SHALL mark the auto-fix as requiring manual intervention

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Feedback and Comment System

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing code, I want to receive clear, actionable feedback directly on problematic code lines, so that I can understand and address issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN posting feedback THEN the system SHALL create inline comments on specific problematic code lines
2. WHEN displaying issues THEN the system SHALL include severity badges, emojis, and clear descriptions
3. WHEN providing summary reports THEN the system SHALL show overall PR health score, metrics, and costs
4. WHEN generating visual diffs THEN the system SHALL provide rich before/after diff visualization
5. IF multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize and group related findings
6. WHEN displaying severity THEN the system SHALL use consistent emoji indicators (üö® Critical, ‚ö†Ô∏è High, üü° Medium, üîµ Low)
7. WHEN showing diffs THEN the system SHALL use diff2html library for syntax-highlighted comparisons

### Requirement 6: Privacy Protection and Security

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the bot to protect sensitive information and credentials, so that our private data is never exposed to external AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing code THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and redact PII, API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data
2. WHEN redacting secrets THEN the system SHALL replace them with generic placeholders before LLM analysis
3. WHEN logging redacted items THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails without storing actual sensitive values
4. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL securely store and manage GitHub tokens
5. IF sensitive patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them as security violations regardless of LLM analysis

### Requirement 7: Team Notifications and Gamification

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to receive real-time notifications about code quality metrics and see team performance trends, so that I can track improvement and celebrate achievements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL send notifications to configured Slack/Discord channels
2. WHEN displaying metrics THEN the system SHALL show team leaderboards with code quality scores
3. WHEN tracking costs THEN the system SHALL include AI usage costs in all notifications and reports
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide daily and weekly team summaries
5. IF cost limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert team administrators

### Requirement 8: Plugin Architecture and Customization
